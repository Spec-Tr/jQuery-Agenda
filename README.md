# jQuery Agenda

## Description

This is a basic agenda app that allows users to fill in events into each hour slot of a typical work day. Additional hours outside of 9-5 have been provided because for many users, planning for actions and logistics related to the workday is not confined merely to working hours and may include commute times, business or other meetings, other routinized activities like visits to the gym or for medical appointments, for example. Agenda entries are saved locally to affect data persistance.
